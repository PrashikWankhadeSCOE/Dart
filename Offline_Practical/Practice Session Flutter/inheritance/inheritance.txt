/*
Test2 is child of Test class
when we pass the value to Test2 constructor
its constuctor has super.x 
so which means it will pass that value to parent constructor
and when we create Test obj and the value passed there weill be assigned to x in the same class
so when we created 1st obj of Test2 the value 10 is send to Test class x 
now x = 10;
but the Test2 has recieved x in inheritance and obj.x will change the valie of x in Test2

now obj2 we pass 30 as value of x 
in class Test the value of x is 30 
so after printing output will be
 
 obj.x = 19
 and obj2.x = 30

Program2 :

/*
here x has inherited but we have created our own x as we are not satisfied with the value from parent class so we have kept it null
but when creating a constructor we have taken x as argument so it will not have null value 
we have created 2 methods in the child Test2
gun() --> which will change the value of x to 8
  as the x is not final so we can change it as many times as we want
fun() --> we are using fun to print the values of x in  the same class and in the paren class

when we create obj x in child class = 10
on calling gun it will change to 8
and when calling fun () it will print
output -->
8
30
